## [Separation of Concerns for Binary Project](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-03-improving-error-handling-and-modularity.html)
  
- Split your program into a _main.rs_ and a _lib.rs_ and move your programâ€™s logic to _lib.rs_.
- As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in _main.rs_.
- When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from _main.rs_ and move it to _lib.rs_.
- The responsibilities that remain in the main function after this process should be limited to the following:
  + Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
  + Setting up any other configuration
  + Calling a `run` function in _lib.rs_
  + Handling the error if `run` returns an error

## Note

- `{` Expression `}`
  + evaluate to a resulting value.
- Statement`;`
  + instructions that perform some action and do not return a value
